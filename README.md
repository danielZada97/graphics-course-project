# üõù Interactive 3D Playground in OpenGL

### üéÆ A First-Person Digital Playground Simulation Built in C with OpenGL

This project is a fully interactive 3D playground, designed using **C** and the **OpenGL** graphics API, along with the **GLUT** utility toolkit. The simulation features animated playground equipment, textured environments, characters, and a first-person navigation system. It was created as part of an academic course and received the **highest grade in class (100)**.

## üß† About the Technology

### C Programming Language
The simulation is written in **C**, a powerful low-level programming language known for its performance and control over system-level operations. C is commonly used in graphics, embedded systems, and game engines.

### OpenGL & GLUT
- **OpenGL** (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-platform graphics API used for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
- **GLUT** (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) provides windowing and input control, making it easier to build OpenGL-based applications.

Together, they enable real-time rendering and keyboard interaction in the 3D playground.

## üñºÔ∏è Textures & Assets

The project uses **BMP images** for applying realistic textures to objects like grass, brick walls, wood, skyboxes, and more. These textures are loaded at runtime and mapped to geometric primitives to simulate a visually engaging environment.

Make sure the following `.bmp` files are in the working directory:
- `sky3.bmp`, `brick.bmp`, `grass1.bmp`, `sun.bmp`, `moon.bmp`, `nametag.bmp`, and many others (see full list in `main.c`)
